Hello welcome to The Market Dashboard. There are two parts to this project with part one being the stock page and part two being the options page. 

1) Stock Page
   The main features of this page will be with the selection of a stock using their symbol a candlestick graph of their past market data will be displayed,
   as well as their current price, volume, all time high for the period and all time low for the period. Then under the graph it will be met with their dividend
   percentage, EPS, and PE.

2) Options Page
   This page will revolve around calculations instead of display like the stock page. For example with a given stock inputted it will display the options contracts data and when
   the user selects one the IV (Involuntary Volatility), and the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) will be calculated as well.

What are the Greeks?

What is IV?
